# Module — Projects

## Purpose
The Projects module provides a Kanban‑style board for planning, tracking, and managing **project** records, as well as the detailed onboarding flow management via **OnboardingDetailPage**. Projects are linked to clients, have a type (onboarding, expansao, interno), status (planejado, em_andamento, concluído, suspenso), milestones, and onboarding flows. The module lets users view project statistics, filter by client, CSM, type, and deadline, drag‑and‑drop projects between status columns, and create or edit projects via a modal dialog.

## Responsibilities
- Display a board with columns for each project status.
- Provide filtering controls (client search, CSM, type, deadline).
- Show summary cards with counts for active, blocked, attention, overdue, and completed projects.
- Allow drag‑and‑drop to change a project's status.
- Persist status changes via `useUpdateProjectStatus` mutation.
- Open **ProjectModal** for creating a new project or editing an existing one.
- Render onboarding detail page with timeline, activities, and fase management.
- Load required reference data (clients, profiles/CSMs, onboarding configurations, catalog items).
- Compute and display statistical drawers (active, blocked, etc.) on demand.

## Module Structure
| File | Responsibility / UI role |
|------|--------------------------|
| `ProjectsPage.jsx` | Main page component: loads projects, onboardings, clients, profiles; renders filter bar, stats cards, Kanban board with drag‑and‑drop; opens the `ProjectModal`. |
| `ProjectModal.jsx` | Modal dialog for creating or editing a project. Handles form state, client selection (combobox for global create), project type selection, capability (capabilities) selection for onboarding/expansao projects, and submission via appropriate mutation hooks. |
| `OnboardingDetailPage.jsx` | Detailed view of an onboarding project: header, timeline (fases), activities list with phase filtering, fase management panel with drag‑and‑drop. |
| `OnboardingStyles.js` | CSS‑in‑JS style objects for onboarding UI components (timeline, activity list, pending items, response picker). |

## Project Types
- **onboarding** – Implantação inicial: Create a new client onboarding flow with fases e capacidades.
- **expansão** – Expansão/upsell to existing client.
- **internal** – Internal project not tied to a client.

## Onboarding Flow Model
### criação
When creating an onboarding/expansão project via `ProjectModal`:
1. A new `projects` record is created with the selected type.
2. A new `onboardings` record is created, linked to the project via `project_id`.
3. Fases are initialized from `onboarding_fase_types` catalog and inserted into `onboarding_fases`.
4. The first fase is marked as `ativa` and set as `fase_atual_id` in the onboarding record.

### Fase Types Catalog
`onboarding_fase_types` table stores available fase templates:
| Column | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Fase name (e.g., "Kickoff", "Levantamento", "Go-Live") |
| `is_milestone` | Boolean – if true, this is a marco (requires evidence/justificativa) |
| `requires_evidence` | Boolean – if true, evidence is required to conclude |

### Fases Per Project
`onboarding_fases` stores fases for each onboarding:
| Column | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `onboarding_id` | FK to onboardings |
| `fase_type_id` | FK to onboarding_fase_types |
| `display_order` | Order in the timeline |
| `status` | `pendente` / `ativa` / `concluida` |
| `planned_start` | Planned start date |
| `planned_end` | Planned completion date |
| `actual_start` | Actual start (set when fase becomes ativa) |
| `actual_end` | Actual end date |
| `occurred_at` | Date the milestone occurred |
| `justificativa` | Justification/memo for milestone completion |

### Fase Status Behavior
| Status | Allowed Actions | Description |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| `pendente` | Salvar (planned dates, justificativa, evidências), Tornar ativa | Waiting to start |
| `ativa` (non‑milestone) | Salvar, Voltar para pendente, Registrar conclusão | In progress |
| `ativa` (milestone) | Salvar, Voltar para pendente, Registrar conclusão (with evidence/justificativa) | In progress (requires evidence) |
| `concluida` | Reabrir fase | Finished |

### Activities
`onboarding_activities` stores tasks within each fase:
| Column | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `fase_id` | FK to onboarding_fases |
| `title` | Activity title |
| `status` | `pendente` / `em_andamento` / `concluida` |
| `due_date` | Deadline |
| `completed_at` | Completion timestamp |
| `responsible_contato_id` | FK to contacts |
| `responsible_interno_id` | FK to profiles |

Activities can be searched inline via `onboarding_activity_types` catalog. New types can be created inline.

### Pendências (Sub‑tasks)
`onboarding_pendencies` stores sub‑tasks under activities:
| Column | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `activity_id` | FK to onboarding_activities |
| `title` | Pendência title |
| `priority` | `bloqueadora` / `alta` / `normal` |
| `status` | `criada` / `em_andamento` / `aguardando_validacao` / `encerrada` |
| `due_date` | Deadline |
| `resp_contato_id` / `resp_interno_id` | Responsible |

## UI Architecture
### ProjectsPage
- **PageHeader** with a "+ Novo Projeto" button that toggles `ProjectModal`.
- **Stats cards** (`StatCard`) display counts for various derived groups; clicking a card opens a `StatsDrawer` showing the underlying items.
- **Filter bar** provides a searchable client dropdown, CSM selector (admin/manager only), type selector, and deadline selector; filters are applied via a `useMemo` derived list.
- **Kanban board** uses `@hello-pangea/dnd` (`DragDropContext`, `Droppable`, `Draggable`). Each column corresponds to a project status defined in `COLUMNS`. Projects are draggable; on drop, `onDragEnd` updates local state and triggers `updateStatus.mutate`.

### ProjectModal
- Two layout modes:
  - **Global create** (no clientId) – shows a combobox to select a client.
  - **Contextual** (clientId supplied or editing) – shows a pill with the current client.
- Form fields: type (segmented control), title, description/notes, responsible (CSM), start/end dates, status, and for onboarding/expansao projects, capability chip selection, kickoff date, and phase info.

### OnboardingDetailPage
- **Header**: project title, client name, badges (type, context, situação, CSM), dates row (start date, Go-Live previsto).
- **Timeline**: PhaseCircles connected by connectors – each circle shows fase name, planned date, and status (color-coded: concluida=green, ativa=blue with glow, pendente=gray).
- **Activities**: List with fase filter tabs (abas), each activity shows title, status select, responsible, due date (overdue in red+bold), and pending count badge.
- **Fase Management**: Drag‑and‑drop to reorder fases, add/remove fases, edit is_milestone and requires_evidence.
- **Modal de Fase**: Form to edit planned dates, actual dates, justification, upload evidence, change status.

### OnboardingStyles
```js
export const styles = {
  timeline: { /* timeline related styles */ },
  activity: { /* activity list styles */ },
  pending:  { /* pending tasks styles */ },
  respPicker: { /* response picker styles */ },
}
```
Each top‑level key contains nested objects that map directly to JSX elements via inline `style` props.

## Data Flow
### Projects Board
1. **Initial data loading** – `useAllProjects`, `useAllOnboardings`, `useClients`, `useProfiles`, `useCatalogItems`, `useOnboardingConfig` fetch data in parallel.
2. **Filtering** – `useMemo` builds `filtered` based on selected client, CSM, type, and deadline criteria.
3. **Stats calculation** – Additional `useMemo` hooks compute subsets for active, blocked, attention, overdue, and month‑concluded projects.
4. **Drag‑and‑drop** – `onDragEnd` updates the local copy of projects (`setLocal`) and calls `updateStatus.mutate({ id, status })` to persist the change.

### Onboarding Detail
1. **Load** – `useOnboarding(id)` fetches the onboarding with all related data (fases, activities, pendencies).
2. **Phase selection** – Default selects the fase with status `ativa`. Abas filter activities by fase_id.
3. **Fase actions** – Complete/milestone functions auto‑advance to the next fase.
4. **Go‑Live completion** – When Go‑Live is concluded, a task is auto‑created to review the client's stage.

## Dependencies
- **Hooks**: `useAllProjects`, `useUpdateProjectStatus`, `useAllOnboardings`, `useClients`, `useProfiles`, `useCatalogItems`, `useOnboarding`, `useOnboardingCapabilities`, `useCreateOnboardingFlow`, `useUpdateOnboardingFlow`, `useCreateInternalProject`, `useUpdateProject`, `useOnboardingConfig`.
- **UI components**: `PageHeader`, `Badge`, `PageSpinner`, `ActionIcons`, `DragDropContext`/`Droppable`/`Draggable`.
- **Routing**: `useNavigate` for navigation from board cards and drawer items.
- **Auth context**: `useAuth` for role‑based filter visibility.
- **Constants**: `FASE_LABELS` for onboarding phase names.

## Integration Points
- **Clients** – projects reference a `client_id`; client data is displayed on cards and used for filtering.
- **Onboardings** – onboarding projects link to onboarding records; capability chips and kickoff dates interact with onboarding flows.
- **Profiles** – CSM/responsible selection pulls from user profiles; role checks determine filter availability.
- **Catalog** – capability chips are built from catalog items (`servico`, `solucao`).
- **Audit Logs** – All actions (created, activated, advanced, reopened, updated) are logged to `audit_logs` table with `entity_type='onboarding_fase'` or `'onboarding_activity'`, `action`, `user_id`, `user_name`.

## Main User Flows
### Flow: View project board
1. User navigates to **/projetos**.
2. `ProjectsPage` loads all data and displays status columns.
3. User can apply filters; the board updates accordingly.
4. Stats cards show aggregate counts; clicking a card opens a drawer with the matching items.

### Flow: Drag project to new status
1. User drags a project card from one column to another.
2. `onDragEnd` receives the source/destination IDs, updates local state, and calls `updateStatus.mutate`.
3. Board re‑renders with the project in its new column.

### Flow: Create new project
1. User clicks **+ Novo Projeto** – `showModal` becomes `true`.
2. `ProjectModal` opens (global mode if no `clientId` prop). User selects a client via combobox, sets type, fills form fields, selects capabilities (if onboarding/expansao), and clicks **Salvar projeto**.
3. Modal calls the appropriate mutation (`createInternalProject` or `createOnboardingFlow`).
4. On success, modal closes and the board refreshes via the projects query.

### Flow: Complete a fase
1. User opens a fase via the timeline.
2. For non‑milestones: concludes if there's at least one completed activity.
3. For milestones: requires evidence or justification.
4. A toast shows with an action button to activate the next fase (optional).
5. The fase status becomes `concluida`.

### Flow: Go-Live completion
1. User concludes the Go-Live fase (a milestone).
2. System checks if `onboarding.context === 'implantacao_inicial'`.
3. If true, an automatic task is created to review the client's stage for migration to "Estabilização".

## State Management
- **Local state** (`useState`) for filter values, drawer key, modal visibility, and a local copy of projects (`local`).
- **React Query / custom hooks** manage server‑side data and expose loading flags (`isLoading`, mutation `isPending`).
- **Form state** inside `ProjectModal` (`form` object) holds field values; `type`, `caps` (selected capabilities), and combobox state are separate.
- **Derived data** (`useMemo`) for filtered lists and statistics ensures efficient recomputation.

## Error Handling
- UI disables the submit button while mutations are pending (`isPending`).
- Basic validation ensures required fields (`title`, client selection, capabilities for onboarding/expansao).
- Toast notifications show success or error messages.

## Performance Considerations
- Data fetching uses parallel hooks; large datasets may benefit from pagination (not implemented).
- Drag‑and‑drop updates local state optimistically before server response, providing immediate UI feedback.
- `useMemo` is used heavily to avoid unnecessary recomputation of filters and stats.

## Known Risks
- No pagination on the board; many projects could degrade performance.
- Filtering and search are performed client‑side on the full project list.
- Mutation errors are not surfaced to the user with explicit toast (relies on react-hot-toast).

## Future Improvements
- Add server‑side pagination / infinite scroll for the project board.
- Implement explicit error toast/notification on mutation failures.
- Refactor filter logic into a reusable hook.
- Extract the large modal UI into smaller subcomponents.
